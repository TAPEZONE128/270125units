# Fundamentals of Database System

## Basic Database Operations
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete â€“ fundamental actions for managing data in databases.
- **Unstructured Data:** Data without a predefined format (e.g., images, videos, social media posts).
- **Structured Data:** Organized data stored in a predefined format (e.g., tables in relational databases).

## Advantages of Using Databases in Business Operations
- Improved data organization and accessibility.
- Enhanced security and data integrity.
- Better decision-making with real-time data.
- Scalability and efficiency in handling large datasets.

## Terminologies
- **Big Data or NoSQL Systems:** Created to manage data for social media applications.
- **Database:** A collection of related data.
- **Data:** Facts that can be recorded.
- **DBMS:** Enables users to create a database system.

## Jobs
- **Database Administrator:** Authorizes access, coordinates, and monitors (accountable for security breaches).
- **Database Designer:** Identifies the data to be stored and chooses the appropriate structure.
- **End Users:** Access the database for querying, updating, and generating reports.
  1. **Casual End Users:** May need different information each time.
  2. **Naive/Parametric End Users:** Make up a sizable portion of database end users.
  3. **Sophisticated End Users:** Familiarize themselves with the facilities of the DBMS.
  4. **Standalone Users:** Maintain a personal database by using ready-made programs that provide an easy-to-use interface.
- **System Analysts:** Determine the requirements for end users.
- **Application Programmers:** Test, debug, document, and maintain (implement specifications as programs).
- **Software Engineer/Developer:** Familiar with the full range of capabilities provided by the DBMS to accomplish their tasks.

## Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach
- **Controlling Redundancy:** Improves performance in queries.
- **Restricting Unauthorized Access:** Provides a security and authorization subsystem.
- **Providing Persistent Storage for Program Details:** Ensures data survives the termination of program execution.
- **Providing Storage Structures and Search Techniques for Efficient Query Processing:** Responsible for choosing an efficient query execution plan.
- **Providing Backup and Recovery:** Supports recovery from hardware or software failures.
- **Providing Multiple User Interfaces:** Offers a variety of user interfaces (e.g., GUIs).
- **Representing Complex Relationships among Data:** Manages numerous varieties of interrelated data.
- **Enforcing Integrity Constraints:** Defines and enforces constraints (e.g., a record must be related to a course record).
- **Permitting Inferencing and Actions Using Rules and Triggers:**
  - **Deductive Databases:** Infer new information using rules.
  - **Triggers:** Automate actions based on table updates.
  - **Stored Procedures & Active Databases:** Enhance automation and enforcement of rules.

## Implications of the Database Approach
- **Enforcing Standards:** DBAs can enforce naming, format, and reporting standards.
- **Reduced Development Time:** New applications can be developed faster with a DBMS.
- **Flexibility:** Structural changes can be made without disrupting data and applications.
- **Up-to-Date Information:** Real-time updates are visible to all users.
- **Economies of Scale:** Consolidation reduces redundancy and costs.

## History of Database Applications
- **Early Databases (Hierarchical & Network Models):** Lacked flexibility and abstraction, requiring complex reorganization for new queries.
- **Relational Databases:** Introduced data abstraction, query languages, and improved flexibility.
- **Object-Oriented Databases (OODBs):** Enhanced modeling for complex applications but had limited adoption.
- **XML & E-Commerce:** Enabled structured data exchange on the web.
- **Specialized Databases:** Used in scientific research, multimedia, spatial data, and time-series applications.
- **Big Data & NoSQL:** Emerged to handle large-scale, non-relational data storage.

## When Not to Use a DBMS
- High initial costs and complexity.
- Simple, static applications.
- Real-time systems with strict performance needs.
- Embedded systems with limited storage.
- Industries like CAD, GIS, and telecommunications often use specialized solutions.
