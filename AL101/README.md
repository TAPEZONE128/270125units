# Algorithm and Complexity

| Linear Search | Binary Search | Jump Search | Interpolation Search |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Linear search compares each element sequentially until a match is found. Linear search checks each element one by one, making it simple but inefficient for large datasets. | Binary search divides the array into halves, eliminating one half each time based on comparison with the middle element. | Jump search is particularly efficient for Arrays with uniformly distributed elements. Jump search works best on sorted, evenly distributed data because it allows skipping elements efficiently | The time complexity of interpolation search in the best case is “O(1)” : If the searched value is located exactly at the calculated probe position, interpolation search can find it in constant time |
