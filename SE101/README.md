# Software Engineering 1

## Software Engineering Overview  
- **Software** - Computer programs and documentation; can be **custom-built** or for the **general market**.  

### Good Software Attributes  
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify and update.  
- **Dependability**: Reliable and secure.  
- **Usability**: User-friendly and intuitive.  
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for performance and resource usage.  

## Software Engineering  
Concerned with all aspects of software production.  

### Key Differences  
- **Software Engineering vs. Computer Science**:  
  - **Computer Science (CS)** focuses on **theory and algorithms**.  
  - **Software Engineering (SE)** focuses on **practical software development**.  
- **Software Engineering vs. System Engineering**:  
  - **Software Engineering** focuses on **software**.  
  - **System Engineering** includes **hardware, processes, and overall system integration**.  

## Core Software Engineering Activities  
1. **Specification** – Defining system requirements.  
2. **Development** – Designing and implementing software.  
3. **Validation** – Ensuring the software meets user needs.  
4. **Evolution** – Maintaining and updating the software.  

## Challenges & Costs  
- **Challenges**:  
  - Managing **diverse system requirements**.  
  - **Reducing delivery time** while maintaining quality.  
  - Ensuring **software reliability**.  
- **Costs**:  
  - **60% Development**, **40% Testing**.  
  - **Software evolution costs** often **exceed initial development** costs.  

## Software Engineering Techniques  
- Different methods apply to different systems:  
  - **Prototyping** for games and user-driven applications.  
  - **Strict specifications** for **safety-critical** systems (e.g., medical or aerospace software).  
- The **Web** has influenced:  
  - Programming languages.  
  - Software reuse.  
  - Distributed systems.  

## Types of Software Applications  
1. **Stand-alone** – Runs on a local computer (e.g., Office apps, CAD tools).  
2. **Interactive Transaction-Based** – Web-based and cloud systems.  
3. **Embedded Control** – Manages hardware devices (e.g., anti-lock brakes, mobile phones).  
4. **Batch Processing** – Processes data in bulk (e.g., billing systems).  
5. **Entertainment** – Games and multimedia applications.  
6. **Modeling & Simulation** – Used in scientific and engineering fields.  
7. **Data Collection** – Gathers sensor data for further processing.  
8. **Systems of Systems** – Integrated software components working together.  

## Software Engineering Ethics  
- **Confidentiality** – Respect client/employer data privacy.  
- **Competence** – Accept only work within expertise.  
- **Intellectual Property** – Protect patents, copyrights, and proprietary information.  
- **Computer Misuse** – Avoid unethical or illegal activities (e.g., hacking, malware).  

## Key Takeaways  
- **Software Engineering** involves all software development activities.  
- **Software isn’t just code**—it includes documentation, maintenance, and user support.  
- Different **software types require specialized development** approaches.  
- **Ethics and professional responsibility** are integral to software engineering.
